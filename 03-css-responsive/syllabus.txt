1. Why Responsive Design Really Matters
-> Real-life examples of broken vs perfectly responsive websites.
-> Impact on user experience, SEO, retention and conversions.
-> Mobile-first as the default way people browse.
-> Industry standards : why every serious frontend dev needs to master this.

2. Units & Viewports: The Real Foundation
    ** Absolute Units **
    -> px (pixels): The most common unit, fixed and doesn't scale.
    
    ** Realtive Units **
    -> em: Relative to the font-size of the parent.
    -> rem: relative to the root element's font-size. Best for consistent scaling.
    -> %: Relative to the parent element's size, used for width, padding, margin, etc.

    ** Viewport Units **
    -> vw, vh: 1% of the viewport's width and height respectively.
    -> vmin, vmax: Based on the smaller or larger value of the viewport's width or height.

    ** Useful Modern Units **
    -> ch: Width of the "0" character in the current font. Useful for input fields.
    -> lh: Relative to the line height of the element
