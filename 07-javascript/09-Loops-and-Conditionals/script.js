// Level 1 - Pure Beginner Practice

// 1. Print numbers from 1 to 10
// Loop from 1 to 10 and print each number.

// 2. Print only even numbers from 1 to 10
// Use a loop and condition to print only even ones.

// 3. Print the word "Yes" 5 Times
// Reverse using a loop

// 4. Print wether numbers from 1 to 10 are even or odd
// For each number, check: even -> "Even", else -> "odd"

// 5. Ask user for a number and say if it's positive or negative
// Use prompt() and a conditional.

// 6. Ask user for a number and say if it's positive or negative
// Use prompt() and a conditional.

// 7. Ask user's age and check if eligible to vote
// If age >= 18 -> "Eligible", else -> "Not eligible"

// 8. Print multiplication table of 5
// Use loop to print 5 x 1 to 5 x 10.

// 9. Count how many numbers between 1 and 15 are greater than 8
// Loop and count conditionally

// 10. Ask user for password and print access status
// Hardcoded correct password, Compare with user input.

// Level 2 - Slightly Tougher but Logical

// 11. Allow only 3 attemps to enter correct password
// If user gets it right early, stop. If not -> "Account Loacked"

// 12. Ask user for words until they type "stop". Count how many times they types "yes"
// Loop until "stop" is typed. Count "yes".

// 13. Print numbers divisible by 7 from 1 to 50
// Use modulo % and loop.

// 14. Sum of all odd numbers from 1 to 30
// Add only odd numbers. Print final sum.

// 15. Keep asking number until user enters an even number.
// Use while loop. Stop only if input is even

// 16. Print numbers between two user inputs
// Input starts and end using prompt() -> print all between.
